// Deep copy - A deep copy of an object is a copy whose properties do not share 
            // the same references (point to the same underlying values) 
            // as those of the source object from which the copy was made.

// Shallow copy - A shallow copy of an object is a copy whose 
                //   properties share the same references (point to the same underlying values) 
                //   as those of the source object from which the copy was made.
